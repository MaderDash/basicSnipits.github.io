### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MaderDash/basicSnipits.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

// You will need a pull DOWN resistor conected to the button for this code to work.
byte buttonPin = 3;  // this is where your button is conected.
bool setState = false; // This varable is the state we are switching.

void setup(){
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);  // Sets the input for the button
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);         // Sets pin 13 to output for the onboard led on the uno board.
}

    /* This first if statment triggers when the button is pulled high.
        If the button is held, this will not keep cycleing, it will only work  one time.
    */

       Then It resets the button for the next press.
